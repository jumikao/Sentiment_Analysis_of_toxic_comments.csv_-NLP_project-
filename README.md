# Sentiment Analysis of toxic_comments.csv
(Final project SDA Data Science course)

"At the end of 2017, the Civil Comments platform shut down and chose to make their ~2m public comments from their platform available in a lasting open archive so that researchers could understand and improve civility in online conversations for years to come. 
Jigsaw (a part of Google) sponsored this effort and extended annotation of this data by human raters for various toxic conversational attributes. "

As a result the file "toxic_comments.csv" was built and released into data science community. 

The task I set myself in this project is to build a model that recognizes the sentiment of the comments and possibly classifies them into hatred/non-hatred.

This analysis was initally a project I worked on during my final assignment of SDA Data Science course. 
I spent about 8 hours on this project during my data science course (1 working day) with the assistance of the mentor, and now I decided to develop it further as my own project.
